3. Redeploy the project

**Error: "Pre-rendering Error"**

- Ensure all environment variables are properly set
- Check your environment variables if using external services
- Verify your configuration files

**Build Performance Issues**

- Add `NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` to disable Next.js telemetry
- Ensure your Vercel plan supports the build requirements

### Local Development Issues

**Environment Variables Not Loading**

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
2. Fill in your actual API keys
3. Restart your development server

**TypeScript Errors**
